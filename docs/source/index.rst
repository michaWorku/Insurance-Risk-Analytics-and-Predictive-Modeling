Welcome to Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling!
=========================================================

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the **Insurance Risk Analytics and Predictive Modeling** project for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The project aims to transform ACIS's traditional insurance pricing into a dynamic, data-driven system by analyzing historical car insurance claims data.

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **A/B Hypothesis Testing**, and **Predictive Modeling**, we uncover critical insights into risk drivers, optimize pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for more targeted marketing.
