Project Overview
================

Introduction
------------
In the competitive insurance landscape, understanding and accurately pricing risk is paramount to profitability and customer satisfaction. This project, undertaken for **AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)**, focuses on building an end-to-end analytics solution to modernize their car insurance pricing models.

Project Goals
-------------
The primary objectives of this initiative are:

* **Transform Pricing:** Move from static, traditional pricing to a dynamic, risk-based system.
* **Optimize Marketing:** Identify low-risk customer segments for targeted campaigns.
* **Improve Profitability:** Reduce premiums for appropriate segments to attract new clients and enhance loss ratios.
* **Enhance Decision-Making:** Provide data-backed insights for strategic business decisions.

Analytical Approach
-------------------
The project is structured into three interconnected phases:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth investigation of data quality, distributions, trends, and initial patterns in claims and profitability.
2.  **A/B Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical validation of business assumptions regarding risk drivers and profit margins across different customer and policy segments.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Development of machine learning models to forecast claim severity, claim probability, and optimize premium calculations.

This multi-faceted approach ensures a robust, data-driven foundation for ACIS's future strategies.
