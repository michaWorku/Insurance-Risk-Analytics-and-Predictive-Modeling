# Insurance Risk Analytics and Predictive Modeling

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling historical car insurance data to support **risk segmentation**, **claim prediction**, and **premium optimization**. It leverages data engineering, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to help identify low-risk customer segments and improve pricing strategies for insurance providers.

Key features include:

* Exploratory data analysis and risk profiling by geography, vehicle type, and customer demographics
* A/B hypothesis testing for statistically validating risk drivers
* Machine learning models to predict claim severity and premium amounts
* Model interpretability using SHAP and LIME to support transparent decision-making
* Reproducible pipeline using Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), and Data Version Control (DVC)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michaWorku/Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling.git
   cd Insurance-Risk-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modeling
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

To run the main analytics or modeling workflows:

```bash
# Example: Running a data preparation or model training script
python src/main.py
```

To launch exploratory notebooks or visualizations:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
